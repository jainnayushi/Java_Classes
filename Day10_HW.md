**Question 2: Shape Hierarchy**

* Create a Java program to implement a hierarchy of shapes. Design classes for `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`.

- `Shape` class should have instance variables for color and filled status. It should also include methods for getting and setting color and filled status.
- `Circle` class should be a subclass of `Shape` and include additional instance variables like radius. Implement methods for calculating area and perimeter of the circle.
- `Rectangle` class should also be a subclass of `Shape` and include instance variables for width and height. Implement methods for calculating area and perimeter of the rectangle.

* Design a `ShapeManager` class to demonstrate the usage of shapes and their properties.
